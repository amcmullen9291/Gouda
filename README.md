Sinatra Portfolio Project 

Users are given a ten digit, randomly generated, Alphanumeric 'Employee ID' as well as being able to choose their own password to make logins unique. Passwords are secured by the Bcrypt gem.

Users can view and update their profile information, delete their profile, or submit a weekly timecard. As a failsafe, the HR portal has access to all employee records by searching for a user by ID number or last name. Only HR can change a name or employee ID. To enter the "HR portal", choose 'Goat Cheese' and enter the word "pangram". then click the "submit" button.

Current employees in DB are: 
Douglas Andersen, Ginger Beckham, Hunter Corbett, Copeland Dixon, Ellis Dixon, Morgan Morris, Mia Nowak, Frank Oak, Cooper Reed, Robin Henry Schyma, Rhys Scotts, Alex Silva, Dennis Thouro Jr., Clark Wesley, and Jason Winthrope.

The H.R. email address is active. Feel free to email suggestions and comments.

Some of the images were created using the Bootstrap gem. The logo was created with the help of Favicon.io.
