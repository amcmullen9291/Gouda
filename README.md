Sinatra Portfolio Project 

Users are given a ten digit, randomly generated, Alphanumeric 'Employee ID' as well as being able to choose their own password to make logins unique. Passwords are secured by the Bcrypt gem.

Users can view and update their profile information, delete their profile, or submit a weekly timecard. As a failsafe, the HR portal has access to all employee records by searching for a user by ID number or last name. Only HR can change a name or employee ID. To enter the "HR portal", choose 'Goat Cheese' and enter the word "pangram". then click the "submit" button.

Current employees in DB are: Jason Winthrope, Rhys Scotts, Ginger Beckham, Hunter Corbett, Ray Felber, Clark Wesley, Morgan Morris, Robin Henry Schyma, Mia Nowak, Dennis Thouro, Alex Silva, and Doug Andersen.

The H.R. email address is active. Feel free to email suggestions and comments.

Some of the images were created using the Bootstrap gem. The logo was created with the help of Favicon.io.
