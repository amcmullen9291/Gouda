Sinatra Portfolio Project 

Users are given a ten digit, randomly generated, Alphanumeric 'Employee ID' as well as being able to choose their own password to make logins unique. Passwords are secured by the Bcrypt gem.

Users can view and update their profile information, delete their profile, or submit a weekly timecard. As a failsafe, the HR portal has access to all employee records by searching for a user by ID number or last name. Only HR can change a name or employee ID. To enter the "HR portal", choose 'Goat Cheese' and enter the word "pangram". then click the "submit" button.

Current employees in DB are: 
Ginger Beckham, Copeland Dixon, Ellis Dixon, Robin Henry Schyma, and Dennis Thouro Jr.

The H.R. email address is active. Feel free to email suggestions and comments.

Some of the images were created using the Bootstrap gem. The logo was created with the help of Favicon.io.
